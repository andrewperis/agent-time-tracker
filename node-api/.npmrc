# Proxy configuration is intentionally commented out.
# npm honors HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY or npm_config_proxy/npm_config_https_proxy environment variables
# automatically. Leaving these values unset prevents npm from treating an empty placeholder as an
# invalid URL. If you need to override proxy settings, set the environment variables above or
# create a local .npmrc with fully qualified proxy URLs.
# proxy=${HTTP_PROXY}
# https-proxy=${HTTPS_PROXY}
